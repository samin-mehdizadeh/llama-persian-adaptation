        "input": "What is the sentiment of the following document towards the entity James Cameron Jack ?  Cameron  had always loved diving and deep-sea exploration  and The Abyss   his  third film as director and sole writer  had been a love letter to both. But that was fantasy; Titanic was real. And when  Cameron  first decided to pursue the project  the prospect of going to the wreck of Titanic might have been incentive enough to pitch the movie. When  he  first met with 20th Century Fox Chairman Peter Chernin to discuss Titanic  in the spring of 1995   he  asked for $2 million to fund a deep-sea expedition. It was an amazing sum of money to the Russian scientists and submersible pilots who took  Cameron  to the wreck. It was nothing compared to Titanic\u00e2\u0080\u0099s final price tag. When Titanic opened in theaters across the US  on the weekend of Dec. 19  1997  it became the No. 1 movie in America by the skin of its teeth  edging out the latest James Bond movie  Tomorrow Never Dies  by a margin of $3.5 million. But to the executives who had nervously overseen Titanic\u00e2\u0080\u0099s production \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and watched its budget nearly double  from $110 to $200 million \u00e2\u0080\u0094 this wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t particularly encouraging news. For Titanic to earn a profit  executives calculated  it would have to attract viewers in utterly unprecedented numbers: Even if it sold more tickets than Dances With Wolves  the most profitable three-hour-long movie ever released  Fox would still be $70 million in the red. And to be a success? It would have to somehow repeat its $28 million opening-weekend ticket sales \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and stay the No. 1 movie in America \u00e2\u0080\u0094 for weeks and weeks in a row  in a way no movie had in nearly a decade. It would have to be more than just a movie. It would have to become a cultural obsession. And it did.  Cameron  had once \u00e2\u0080\u0094 optimistically  as the final budget reflected \u00e2\u0080\u0094 called Titanic \"a $190 million chick flick.\" By Jan. 31  1998  20th Century Fox estimated that 7% of all American teenage girls had seen the movie twice. They weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the only ones going back to see Titanic a second time  and perhaps a third  though they did receive the most press. In 1997  the average return viewer rate for a theatrically released movie was 2%. Meanwhile  Titanic\u00e2\u0080\u0099s was 20%. In February 1998  a survey found that 76% of Titanic's repeat viewers still planned to see it again. It made more money \u00e2\u0080\u0094 $32 million \u00e2\u0080\u0094 during its 11th weekend in theaters than it did during its first. (It helped that this weekend also happened to fall on Valentine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Day.) Theaters that previously worried about losing money on a movie they could screen only two or three times a day started squeezing in showings as early as 8 a.m. and as late as midnight  letting out satisfied viewers at 3:30 in the morning. Adults  people with families  responsibilities  and jobs  flocked to see Titanic. Because for a little while \u00e2\u0080\u0094 for 3 hours and 14 minutes  to be precise \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the rest of their lives disappeared. Titanic gave people a way to make the rest of their lives disappear  and so they kept coming back  and finding that the world  James Cameron  had created for them still felt just as real as it had the first time. What made Titanic not just a movie  but a destination? And what did it take to will such a world into solid reality?",
