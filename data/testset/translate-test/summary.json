Therefore, reformist candidates participate in the elections of the 11th session of the Islamic Council without a list. [n] He added: Probably, some candidates have been disqualified for financial reasons, for which documentation should be provided. It is not possible to accuse people of financial corruption and deprive them of their social rights just by the existence of some reports. Many reformist candidates have been disqualified based on the clauses of the election law that have a political approach; I have also been disqualified based on paragraph 2 of article 28 of the election law, which is non-compliance with the system of the Islamic Republic; Most of the reformists have also been disqualified based on clauses 2 and 4 of Article 28 of the Constitution. Determining whether a candidate is committed to the Islamic Republic of Iran is based on personal judgments, taste, and a certain political approach.

[n] He said: I don't like the numbers that are mentioned about the volunteers of the old system. These numbers are raised by those who do not have information. In fact, in 2019, we had 259,000 people who volunteered for the old system, out of which about 63,000 tried the questions of the new system due to the fact that the choice of the type of system was optional last year, and the number of questions printed in the 2019 entrance exam was 196,000. It was asked that 53,000 of these people are volunteers who have graduated from associate degree, bachelor's and master's degrees. [n] He continued: About 142,000 of the above candidates were those who took the entrance examination at least 3 times, of which 117 were candidates for experimental sciences. In fact, all of these candidates wanted to be admitted to the three fields of medicine, dentistry and pharmacy. Otherwise, below 8% of the old system volunteers are volunteers of other educational groups and disciplines. [n] The head of the country's assessment organization added: The numbers they announce about the volunteers of the old system are not really correct and I request those who do not have information not to confuse the minds of the volunteers and the society. [n] Khodayi emphasized: The last year that the candidates of the old system entered the entrance exam was in 2019, when they took the entrance exam of the old system at least three times from 2017 to 2019. In 2018 and 2019, the Evaluation and Admission Council approved the entrance exam of the applicants of the old system for the last time. In fact, we announced a year ago that 99 is the last year of the old system entrance exam. [n] He added: But the main problem of the new and old system volunteers is that our secondary education system has changed since 2014. For three years, we designed common questions for the candidates of two systems, and in order for our questions to be equal and to eliminate the difficulty, we have to emphasize the common part in the entrance exam. [n] The head of the memory assessment organization indicated: In order for the questions to be equal, the new topics of the secondary education system will be discussed less in the exam. As a result, neither the student nor the teacher will pay attention to the changes in the secondary education system that started more than 6 years ago. While the changes in the secondary education system have been made based on the document of the fundamental transformation of education, so the entire education system of the country cannot be suspended for some people who only want to enter the three fields of medicine, dentistry and pharmacy. [n] He emphasized: We announced the changes in the entrance exam a year ago and all the arguments were reviewed and announced in the relevant centers, so what was approved is the approval of the National Education Evaluation Council and the entrance exam of 1400 was determined based on this approval. There is no other agenda that we want to review again in the assessment and acceptance council. The application of entrance examination candidates has been examined because this council had no approval without these applications. [n] The head of the National Assessment Organization pointed out: According to the Assessment and Acceptance Council, the old and new system files for the 1400 entrance exam are closed, and the new system questions will be asked next year. The curriculum content of the new system is also simpler than the old system, so I recommend that candidates study the materials that have many commonalities in this one year when they have time.

    "input": "فضل الله باقرزاده در گفتگو با خبرنگار مهر با یادآوری اینکه قرار بود اردوی تیم‌های ملی شمشیربازی در دو اسلحه اپه و فلوره از هفته دوم آبان ماه آغاز شود، گفت: برای تعیین محل برگزاری اردو رایزنی‌هایی با استان‌های یزد، خراسان رضوی، اصفهان، آذربایجان غربی، اردبیل و مرکزی داشتیم تا بتوانیم با توجه به شرایط کرونا و پروتکل‌هایی که ملزم به رعایت‌شان هستیم، مطمئن‌ترین محل را برای اردو انتخاب کنیم. [n] وی تصریح کرد: پروتکل‌های بهداشتی برای شمشیربازی خیلی سختگیرانه است که لزوم گرفتن تست PCR و حضور در قرنطینه بخشی از آن به حساب می‌آید. با این حال مبنا را بر این قرار داده بودیم که حتما اردوی خود را از هفته آینده آغاز کنیم اما موج سوم کرونا و آمار بالایی که تعداد مبتلایان دارند، برای‌مان چاره‌ای نگذاشت جز لغو برنامه ریزی‌های انجام شده. [n] رئیس فدراسیون شمشیربازی در مورد زمان جدید پیش بینی شده برای برگزاری اردوی تمرینی ملی پوشان این رشته خاطرنشان کرد: هیچ چیز مشخص نیست. باید ببینیم کرونا چه شرایطی را برای‌مان رقم می‌زند تا بر اساس آن اقدام به برنامه ریزی کنیم. باید تا پایان سال اردو داشته باشیم اما نمی‌دانیم کجا و چه زمانی! کرونا دست مان را بد در پوست گردو گذاشته است. به محض بهبود شرایط فعلی و نزدیک‌تر شدن به شرایط عادی برای اردوها برنامه ریزی می‌کنیم. [n] باقرزاده با تاکید بر اینکه ملی پوشان شمشیربازی در اسلحه‌های مختلف پیگیر تمرینات‌شان هستند، تصریح کرد: درست است که تا پایان سال ۲۰۲۰ میلادی هیچ رویدادی در آسیا و جهان برگزار نمی‌شود اما طبق اعلام فدراسیون جهانی در فاصله زمانی ۲۰ فروردین ماه تا ۱۰ اردیبهشت ماه رقابت‌های زون قاره‌ای کهک از مرحله از توزیع سهمیه‌های المپیک هستند، برگزار خواهند شد. ایران هم از جمله شرکت کنندگان در مسابقات زون آسیاست. بنابراین باید تا پایان سال اردوهایی داشته باشیم که آمادگی لازم برای اعزام را به دست بیاوریم. [n] وی با اشاره به اینکه ایران ۵ نماینده در مسابقات شمشیربازی زون آسیا خواهد داشت، تاکید کرد: در هر یک از اسلحه‌های سابر بانوان، اپه مردان و بانوان و فلوره مردان و بانوان یک نماینده اعزامی خواهیم داشت. در سابر مردان هیچ نماینده‌ای اعزام نمی‌شود چراکه سهمیه تیمی این اسلحه برای المپیک به دست آمده است. [n] رئیس فدراسیون شمشیربازی خاطرنشان کرد: اینکه چه نفراتی به زون آسیا اعزام می‌شوند، مشخص نیست. شمشیربازان اعزامی با برگزاری مسابقات انتخابی مشخص خواهند شد. به خاطر ماه‌ها دوری از تمرین و مسابقات باید این رقابت‌ها را خیلی نفسگیرانه برگزار کنیم. همین موضوع هم دلیل دیگری بر عزم جدی فدراسیون برای برگزاری اردوهای آماده سازی است. [n] وی افزود: مجوز لازم برای آغاز به کار برنامه‌های شمشیربازی خیلی دیر صادر شد. اگر این مجوز را مثلا دو ماه پیش که شرایط کلی کرونا در کشور بهتر بود، دریافت می‌کردیم حتما اردوهای خود را آغاز می‌کردیم اما الان شرایط اصلا خوب نیست. برگزاری اردو و تمرین متمرکز در این شرایط ریسک بالایی می‌خواهد که ما نداریم. به محض دور شدن از شرایط فوق قرمز فعلی و عادی‌تر شدن وضعیت برای این مهم اقدام می‌کنیم اما واقعا مشخص نیست چه زمانی. [n] باقرزاده گفت: زمانیکه شرایط برای اردوی متمرکز مهیا شد قطعا اردوی تیم ملی اسلحه سابر را هم برگزار می‌کنیم. در حال حاضر مجتبی عابدینی و علی پاکدامن در آکادمی ملی المپیک و محمد رهبری و محمد فتوحی در شهرستان‌های خود پیگیر تمرینات‌شان هستند. سرمربی تیم ملی (پیمان فخری) هم نظارت لازم را بر روند کارهای شان دارد اما منتظر اولین فرصت هستیم تا این شمشیربازان بتوانند کنار یکدیگر تمرینات شان را دنبال کنند. [n] رئیس فدراسیون شمشیربازی در پایان از اقدام این فدراسیون برای کمک به وضعیت معیشتی اهالی این رشته در دوره کرونا گفت و یادآور شد: از دو ماه پیش در قالب بسته حمایتی کمک مالی به ملی پوشان فلوره و اپه (مردان و بانوان) و سابر (بانوان) داریم. ۲۰ مربی فعال در شهرستان‌ها هم شامل این کمک می‌شوند. در مجموع بسته حمایتی فدراسیون شامل ۴۰ نفر می‌شود. در قالب این بسته ماهیانه ۵۰۰ هزار تومان به افراد تعلق می‌گیرد.",

    "input": "به گزارش خبرنگار ایمنا، محمد مهدی زاهدی در نشست خبری در جمع خبرنگاران اصفهان با اشاره به میزان بودجه اختصاص داده شده به پژوهش، اظهار داشت: بعد از ارائه لایحه بودجه به مجلس، نمایندگان به مدت ۱۰ روز فرصت دارند تا نظرات خود را پیرامون موارد اختصاص داده شده به بودجه عنوان کنند و قطعا بخشی از این بررسی‌ها و اظهارات به بودجه اختصاصی به پژوهش در نظر گرفته شده است. [n] وی در ادامه افزود: علی رغم اینکه ما قوانین کاملا واضح و آشکاری را بدون هیچ تبصره و تبیین خاصی در مورد مباحث بودجه کشور داریم و هر سالهک درصد بودجه به مباحث پژوهشی اختصاص داده می‌شود، اما در سال ۹۵ تنها ۴۶ درصد بودجه پژوهشی در کشور عملیاتی شد که فاصله بسیاری با آنچه که قانون بود داشته است. [n] رئیس کمیسیون آموزش و تحقیقات مجلس شورای اسلامی خاطر نشان کرد: بعید میدانم در سال جدید هم این میزان به این یک درصد برسد؛ همه کشور هایی که دچار مشکلات و بحران‌های اقتصادی بودند برای بازسازی کشورشان، اولویت بودجه خود را به پژوهش اختصاص می‌دهند و این در حالی است که در کشور ما پژوهش در رده‌های آخر اولویت بندی قرار دارد. [n] وی با اشاره به تصویب ۲ قانون در رابطه با کم رنگ شدن کنکور گفت: در سال‌های ۸۷ و ۹۲ قوانینی تصویب و پیش بینی شد که بستری برای آزمون‌های استاندارد در سه سال آخر متوسطه فراهم کنند که بعد از گذشت پنج سال حداقل ۸۵ درصد ورودی‌های دانشگاه‌ها از طریق نمرات آزمون استاندارد تعیین شوند؛ اما برای برخی رشته‌های پر متقاضی در دانشگاه‌های مطرح، آزمون‌های استاندارد نمی‌تواند پوشش کافی و لازم را برای آنها داشته باشد در نتیجه ما شورایی را در قانون سنجش و پذیرش دانشجو تعیین کردیم که تصمیم بگیرد از سال ۹۸ به بعد بر این اساس برای رشته‌های پر متقاضی دانشجو گرفته شود و برای بقیه رشته‌ها بر اساس آزمون استاندارد دانشجو پذیرش شود. [n] مسئولین اجرایی باور به توانایی محققین و دانشجویان ندارند [n] رئیس کمیسیون آموزش و تحقیقات در ادامه افزود: مسئولین اجرایی کشور ما هنوز به توانایی محققین و دانشگاه‌های ما نکرده‌اند و ندارند و باید اولویت را به نیروهای توانمند داخل کشور بدهیم که حتی اگر سال اول که محصولی را تولید می‌کنند، کیفیت برند خارجی را نداشته باشد اما یقینا هزینه‌ها به شدت کاهش پیدا می‌کند و فناوری را بر اساس علم بومی خودمان ایجاد می‌کنیم؛ در این راستا فرهنگ سازی و خودباوری برای خود کفایی در استقلال حوزه‌های مختلف علم و فناوری یک ضرورت اجتناب ناپذیر است. [n] وی با بیان اینکه محتوای دروس متناسب با نیاز جامعه امروز نیست، گفت: نظام آموزش در دوره دبیرستان و دانشگاه متناسب با نیاز‌های کشور نیست و توجه کمتری به مباحث حرفه‌ای و مهارت آموزی و کارآفرینی داشته‌ایم، از این رو وزارت آموزش و پرورش ملزم شده است به سمت آموزش مهارتی حرکت کنند و همچنین در آموزش و عالی موضوع آمایش سرزمین به طور جدی دنبال می‌شود و براساس برنامه ششم توسعه به جایی رسیدیم که آموزش و پرورش در سال ۱۴۰۰ باید شامل ۵۰ درصد آموزش مهارتی باشد و آموزش عالی نیز از ۲۲ درصد آغاز شده و به ۳۰ درصد برسد. [n] زاهدی در ادامه افزود: کار بزرگی که انجام داده‌ایم طرحی را تحت عنوان مباحث آموزش مهارتی و صلاحیت حرفه‌ای کهکی از قوانین مترقی در حوزه آموزش است را ارائه داده‌ایم که بیشتر به صلاحیت حرفه‌ای توجه شود و با توجه به اینکه مدرک گرایی در کشور اهمیت پیدا کرده و استخدام‌ها بر اساس مدرک صورت می‌گیرد، این قانون بسیار کابردی است. [n] وی با اشاره به اینکه سه قانون در راستای ایجاد بستر برای ارتباط صنعت و دانشگاه طرح شده که بر اساس قوانین برنامه ششم توسعه در ارتباط با این موضوع اگر پروژه‌ای در دستگاهی بدون نظارت دانشگاها شورای عالی عتف باشد دستگاه به آن بودجه‌ای را نمی‌دهد که این بستر خوبی برای همکاری بیشتر صنعت و دانشگاه ایجاد می‌کند. [n] نماینده مردم کرمان با اشاره به اینکه هیچ کس در مجلس حتی رئیس مجلس نمی‌تواند بگوید من قول می‌دهم این کار را انجام می‌دهم، خاطر نشان کرد: به دلیل اینکه همه چیز باید در صحن عنوان و رای گیری انجام شود هیچ کس نمی‌تواند از سوی خود قولی بدهد و طرحی را که به امضای نمایندگان مجلس در خصوص به کار گیری حق التدریس‌ها در آمد کاملا خلاف قانون اساسی بود و در کمیسیون این طرح رد شد؛ بنابراین از این طرح چشم پوشی و آنچه که تصویب شد از میان همه کسانی که مصوبه ۹۵ شامل آن‌ها می‌شود، آزمونی اختصاصی گرفته شود، یعنی کسانی که پیش از سال ۹۵ سابقه تدریس در دبستان و پیش‌دبستانی داشته‌اند.",

[n] هافبک پرسپولیس در خصوص تعویق چند روزه لیگ برتر خاطرنشان کرد: به هر حال پرسپولیس آخرین تیم ایرانی بود که از لیگ قهرمانان آسیا برگشت و از طرفی ما بازیکنان زیادی در تیم ملی داشتیم اما به هر حال تصمیم گیرنده در این زمینه ستاد مقابله با کرونا و سازمان لیگ است. برای ما خیلی فرقی نمی‌کند که لیگ چه زمانی آغاز شود بلکه وظیفه ما تلاش و تمرین مناسب است اما تصمیمات در این خصوص را مسئولان ارشد ورزشی می‌گیرند و این مسئله به ما ارتباطی پیدا نمی‌کند. امیدوارم هرچه سریع‌تر شرایط کشور و همه مردم دنیا به شرایط ایده‌آل برگردد. [n] امیری در خصوص دیدار پرسپولیس مقابل سایپا در هفته اول لیگ برتر تصریح کرد: طبیعی است که ما در همه بازی‌ها برای برد به زمین می‌رویم. خوشبختانه در این چند سال روند خوبی داشتیم به طوری که همه تیم‌ها با تلاش چندین برابری در مقابل ما حاضر می‌شوند چرا که می‌خواهند مقابل پرسپولیس قرار بگیرند و ما را شکست دهند. سایپا هم تیم جوان و خوبی است و همیشه حریف قدری برای ما بوده اما این مسئله باعث نمی‌شود که ضمن احترام به این تیم برای کسب سه امتیاز تلاش نکنیم. همه هدف ما این است که با حداکثر امتیاز از زمین خارج شویم. [n] وی در خصوص شکست در بازی تدارکاتی مقابل مس رفسنجان افزود: بازی خیلی خوبی بود چراکه این بازی فشار جسمانی زیادی به تیم ما وارد کرد اما به هر حال بعد از یک فشار سنگین، کار خیلی سخت است کهک تیم دوباره به اوج برسد. هرچند که این صحبت‌های من کیفیت فنی مس رفسنجان را زیر سوال نمی‌برد. آنها تیم خیلی خوبی هستند و برخلاف ما که حدود یک هفته تا ۱۰ روز است دور هم جمع شدیم آنها مدت زیادی است که در کنار هم تمرین می‌کنند. [n] امیری ادامه داد: با وجود اینکه ما در هر بازی برای بردن به زمین می‌رویم اما فلسفه بازی‌های تدارکاتی همین است که نقاط ضعف و قوت شناسایی شود و نتیجه خیلی مهم نیست. درست است که پرسپولیس حتی در بازی‌های دوستانه هم باید برنده شود اما چیزی که در بازی‌های تدارکاتی مهم است درک مشکلات و تقویت نقاط ضعف است. [n] هافبک پرسپولیس در پاسخ به این سوال که بعد از چهار قهرمانی متوالی حالا هواداران منتظر پنجمین عنوان قهرمانی متوالی هستند خاطر نشان کرد: بازیکنانی که به پرسپولیس اضافه شدند بسیار با کیفیت هستند و عملکرد خوب آنها را در لیگ قهرمانان آسیا همه دیدند. خوشبختانه پرسپولیس شخصیت بالا و برنده‌ای دارد که همیشه برای قهرمانی و بردن وارد مسابقات می‌شود. حس برتری‌جویی در هر بازیکن پرسپولیس وجود دارد و این مسئله کاملا قابل حس است. [n] وی افزود: کار ما سخت اما تلاش می‌کنیم، همانطور که تا اینجا تلاش کردیم و توانستیم موفقیت‌های زیادی به دست بیاوریم. مطمئنا با همت و تلاش کادر فنی و بازیکنان و حمایت‌هایی که هواداران و مسئولان باشگاه انجام می‌دهند دوباره قادر خواهیم بود جایگاهی را به دست بیاوریم که هواداران منتظرش هستند. امیدوارم که فصل آیندهک فصل خوب فوتبالی برای ما و هواداران باشد و بتوانیم یک قهرمانی دیگر را به کارنامه پرسپولیس اضافه کنیم. البته باید پذیرفت که واقعا کار ساده‌ای مقابل ما نیست. [n] بازیکن ملی پوش پرسپولیس در خصوص بازگشت از قطر و حضور در اردوی تیم ملی در ازبکستان و ترکیه و سپس ملحق شدن به تمرینات پرسپولیس و اینکه چقدر از نظر بدنی تحت فشار بوده اظهار داشت: در سال گذشته و به دلیل اتفاقاتی که رخ داد، لیگ در شرایط عجیبی قرار داشت به طوری که هیچ بازیکنی نمی‌دانست از چه زمانی باید خود را آماده مسابقات کند. در این وضعیت خیلی از بازیکنان با تمرینات اختصاصی سعی می‌کردند خود را در شرایط نرمال قرار دهند و من هم از این قاعده مستثنی نبودم. [n] وی ادامه داد: حدود ۲، ۳ ماه به صورت اختصاصی تمرین می‌کردم. آن هم در شرایط سخت قرنطینه که این مسئله باعث شد فشار زیادی به بازیکنان وارد شود. من هم دچار چنین شرایطی بودم. بعد از اینکه از اردوی تیم ملی برگشتم خوشبختانهحیی گل‌محمدی به من و سایر ملی‌پوشان استراحت بیشتری داد که این مسئله خیلی کارساز بود اما باید صادقانه بگویم که خستگی ۱۴، ۱۵ ماه لیگ فرسایشی فصل گذشته هنوز به صورت کامل از تن من خارج نشده است. با این همه ما انتظارات هواداران را می‌دانیم و تلاش خواهیم کرد که خیلی زود به شرایط نرمال و مدنظر هواداران برسیم تا دوباره دل آنها را شاد کنیم.",

[n] However, the latest announcement by Latifi, the spokesperson of the Iranian Customs, indicates that the agreement between the parties has been reached and the issue resolved. [n] According to his explanation, it is decided that in the first stage, 1700 tankers containing fuel that have been stopped at the Bashmaq border and 1000 tankers at the Parviz Khan border will move, 50% of which will enter Iraq as a single shipment and the other 50% will be transshipment. ; so that the fuel will be unloaded in the tanks installed at the border and from there the Iraqi trucks will carry the goods. [n] The spokesperson of Iranian customs continued: But after the stopped trucks are finished, the conditions will be such that all tankers will enter Iraq as a single shipment, with the difference that Iraqi trucks can also transport fuel from the origin to the destination. Therefore, the transfer will no longer be in the form of transshipment. [n] The story of Iranian fuel tankers stopping at the border of the Kurdistan Region goes back to the fact that in the past and to some extent before Corona, the transfer of fuel was carried out in the form of one-way transport, but at the same time as Corona and due to the issues related to Iraq's health protocols, it was decided until the entry of fuel is done in the form of transshipment; Iranian trucks have to unload the fuel in the built-in tanks at the border and Iraqi trucks have to load and transfer it, which affected the possibility of quick unloading and relocation to some extent due to the long process. [n] But later on, it was decided that the transfer of fuel should be carried out in the form of transshipment at the same time, he said: But because the possibility of transshipment was more available at Parviz Khan border, Iraqi trucks also received a reasonable fare for transporting goods from the border to the destination. and on the one hand it was considered as a kind of competition with Iranian trucks, but considering that the one-way transport of Iranian trucks was also added to it, it caused some Iraqis to protest about the fact that problems were created for Iranian truckers on the route to Bashmaq and Drivers were worried about traffic.",

Finally, a social wave is formed that changes the predicted result; We saw the last of this wave in 2016, and the reformers still hope that the waves of 2016, 2016 and 2016 will form again. [n] He further clarified: But I am not really optimistic that such a wave will be created. The matter is over these words and Mr. Rouhani brought disaster to the election fund with his performance that many people are disillusioned with voting. In these three years, since 2016, no positive changes have been made in the country. Mr. Rouhani really cannot say that there has been a positive change during his presidency. No change was felt in foreign policy, domestic policy, economy and culture, and the economic situation of the people weakened day by day. With such a situation, it is very unlikely that anything special will happen until the election day of 1400.

Mr. Aref entered the parliament four years ago with one and a half million votes as the first person in Tehran, but in the 1998 elections, the list of reformists did not get a total of 80,000 votes.

First, I think it is unlikely that the Guardian Council will do this to achieve maximum participation. And secondly, on the assumption that the Guardian Council approves all the reformist candidates for maximum participation, and even beyond that approves the qualification of Mr. Seyed Mohammad Khatami, the social body of the reformists will still not go to the polls.

    "input": "به گزارش خبرآنلاین، اهمیت و تاثیر نوسانات نرخ ارز بر تمام بازارها، تجربه‌های تلخ مکرر از این تعامل و رابطه است که فضای اقتصادی کشور را متحول و متلاطم می‌کند. اما این رابطه و پیامدهای نوسانات قیمت ارز بر بازار مسکن چیست؟ خشایار باقرپور در این باره اظهار کرد: برابری پول رایج کشور با نرخ ارز هموارهکی از مهم‌ترین شاخص‌های قیمت‌گذاری در تمام بازارهای کشور بوده است و آنچه اهمیت این موضوع را دو چندان می‌کند، کاهش ارزش ریال در برابر دلار در مدت ‌زمانی طولانی و قدرت گرفتن دلار در مقابل پول ملی است. وی افزود: نرخ ارز دو تاثیر مستقیم و غیرمستقیم و نیز در کوتاه‌ مدت و بلند مدت بر مسکن داشته است. تاثیر کوتاه‌ مدت و مستقیم آن بر بازار مسکن دقیقا معکوس بوده و منجر به هدایت نقدینگی به سمت بازار ارز و دور شدن از این بازار می‌شود. همانطور که بارها در کشور تجربه شده که وقتی قیمت ارز رو به رشد می‌گذارد، در کوتاه مدت و به سرعت، اغلب کسانی که سرمایه نقدی دارند برای کسب سود ناشی از افزایش قیمت دلار، به سمت خرید آن می‌روند و همین موضوع به تدریج منجربه رکود در بازار مسکن خواهد شد. وی ادامه داد: در تاثیرگذاری غیر مستقیم و بلند مدت، افزایش نرخ ارز روی تمام ارکان حوزه مسکن تاثیر مثبت و موازی داشته و هرچه بازه زمانی افزایش نرخ ارز طولانی‌تر باشد قیمت مصالح و سایر نهاده‌های تولید مسکن نیز به ‌تبع آن رشد کرده و در نهایت روی محصول نهایی که همان مسکن است، تاثیر می‌گذارد. مدیرعامل اتحادیه تعاونی‌های عمرانی شهر تهران تاکید کرد: در این میان افزایش قیمت زمین، متاثر از تورم عمومی جامعه و بالا رفتن نرخ عوارض و هزینه مجوزهای ساخت و ساز هم تاثیر مضاعفی بر افزایش قیمت مسکن خواهد گذاشت. [n] تاثیر نرخ ارز بر قیمت مسکن [n] باقرپور گفت: از مرداد ۱۳۹۶ که نرخ هر دلار آمریکا ۳۸۰۰ تومان بود تا آبان امسال، که ارزش هر یک دلار به بالای ۲۶۰۰۰ تومان رسید، در واقع طی کمتر از ۴۰ ماه، نرخ دلار افزایش بیش از ۵۰۰ درصدی را ثبت کرد. اگر چه در طول این دوره در مقاطعی، بازار، نرخ حدود ۳۲۰۰۰ تومان را هم تجربه کرد و گاهی هم با کاهش کمتر از ۲۰ درصد رشد منفی را به ثبت رساند، اما آنچه در بازار مسکن رخ می‌دهد این است که هر چه دامنه زمانی رشد قیمت ارز طولانی‌تر باشد، میزان اثرگذاری آن بر روی بازار ملک و مسکن هم بیشتر بوده و در ادامه، چسبندگی و ماندگاری بیشتری نیز روی قیمت‌های بالا پیدا خواهد کرد. مدیرعامل اتحادیه تعاونی‌های عمرانی شهر تهران با اشاره به انتخابات آمریکا به عنوان یک رویداد سیاسی بیان کرد: پیروزی هر یک از طرفین، اگر چه حداقل در کوتاه مدت در اقتصاد کشور ما و مدیریت داخلی آن تاثیر قابل اعتنایی نخواهد داشت، اما بخشی از جریان نقدینگی کشور را دچار هیجانات زودگذر کرده و نرخ ارز کمی کاهش پیدا کرد. با همین کاهش کوتاه مدت و ناچیز، در مقابل افزایش بی سابقه به ویژه طی یک سال اخیر، عده‌ای شروع به دادن اطلاعات نادرست کرده و این شائبه را ایجاد کردند که کاهش نرخ ارز منجر به کاهش قیمت مسکن خواهد شد. وی تصریح کرد: شاید کاهش قیمت مسکن در بلند مدت و با کاهش چشمگیر قیمت دلار رخ بدهد، اما چگونه می‌توان از این کاهش کم، مقطعی و کوتاه‌ مدت، بعد از سالها گرانی نرخ ارز، انتظار ریزش قیمت مسکن را داشت؟ حال‌ آن که قیمت مسکن به‌ جز نرخ ارز، به عوامل و شاخص‌های مهم اقتصادی دیگری نیز وابسته است که مهم‌ترین آن‌ها قیمت زمین و مصالح است که در اثر گران شدن ارز، چنانچه پیشتر گفته شد، خود به ‌خود، روند قیمتی فزاینده داشته‌اند. باقرپور معتقد است: هیچ یک از نوسانات منفی قیمت ارز در ۴۰ سال گذشته، حتی در زمان پذیرش قطعنامه ۵۹۸ که منجر به حداکثر ریزش ارزش دلار در برابر پول ملی شد نیز، تاثیر شگرف و متناسبی بر قیمتهای بازار مسکن نداشته و اساسا آن چه که امروز در بوق و کرنا میرکنند، مسبوق به سابقه نیست. [n] *نوسانات قیمت ارز، در تمام بازارهای سرمایه‌ای احتمالا فقط بر حباب قیمتها تاثیر می‌گذارد. [n] مدیرعامل اتحادیه تعاونی‌های عمرانی شهر تهران افزود: آنچه در موضوع اثرات کاهش یا افزایش نرخ ارز در بازار مسکن کاملا مشهود و ثابت‌شده، این است که کاهش نرخ ارز، همواره کوتاه‌ مدت، مقطعی و به دلیل بروز برخی هیجانات بوده و به ‌صورت کوتاه‌ مدت مجددا به سطح قبل و چه ‌بسا بالاتر از آن رسیده است. این نوسانات به دلیل سنگینی بازار مسکن، هرگز قدرت تاثیر منفی بر قیمت بازار را نداشته و نمی‌توان امیدوار بود که قیمت رهن و اجاره و خرید ملک با ۳ یا ۴ هزار تومان کاهش ارز پایین بیاید. [n] وی خاطر نشان کرد: در نهایت شاید بتوان امیدوار بود که نوسانات قیمت ارز، فقط بر آن بخش از اعداد و ارقامی که امروزه به عنوان حباب قیمت، در تمام بازارهای سرمایه‌ای مطرح می‌شود تاثیر بگذارد. باقرپور تاکید کرد: کارشناسان ما در اتحادیه تعاونی‌های عمرانی شهر تهران با بررسی مستمر روند نوسانات نرخ ارز و تحلیل‌های کارشناسی، بارها بر این نکته تاکید کرده‌اند که با کاهش مقطعی نرخ ارز، آدرس غلط به بازار نداده و بازار و مشتریان را به فاز احتیاط سوق ندهیم. چرا که این احتیاط در معامله، نه‌ تنها منجر به تعمیق رکود در بازار مسکن می‌شود، بلکه بعد از اتمام دوره کاهش نرخ ارز و یا حتی معکوس شدن آن، متاسفانه قدرت خرید مشتریان به ‌هیچ‌ عنوان با قبل از این نوسان قابل قیاس نبوده و دیگر توان خرید قبل را نخواهند داشت. [n] وی عنوان کرد: از این‌ رو ما همواره به مشتریان و سرمایه‌گذاران در حوزه مسکن توصیه می‌کنیم با در نظر گرفتن شرایط اقتصادی روز کشور و به ‌دور از هرگونه هیجان و شتاب ‌زدگی و انتظارات غیرمنطقی، تصمیم صحیح را برای خرید یا رهن و اجاره مسکن گرفته و این تصمیم را به بعد از کاهش نرخ ارز یا دوره زمانی دیگری موکول نکنند باقرپور گفت: متاسفانه قدرت خرید مشتریان به ‌هیچ‌ عنوان با قبل از این نوسان قابل قیاس نبوده و دیگر توان خرید قبل را نخواهند داشت. از این‌ رو ما همواره به مشتریان و سرمایه‌گذاران در حوزه مسکن توصیه می‌کنیم با در نظر گرفتن شرایط اقتصادی روز کشور و به ‌دور از هرگونه هیجان و شتاب ‌زدگی و انتظارات غیرمنطقی، تصمیم صحیح را برای خرید یا رهن و اجاره مسکن گرفته و این تصمیم را به بعد از کاهش نرخ ارز یا دوره زمانی دیگری موکول نکنند.",

[n] Agence France-Presse quoted him as speaking in a video conference in Hamburg today and wrote: There is no contradiction between a close relationship between the two sides of the Atlantic Ocean and the strengthening of Europe in the defense sector.

He pointed out that so far about 75% of the total costs and facilities of NATO have been provided by the United States of America. [n] According to him, to fully compensate for these cases, the costs expected from other NATO members will be beyond their means. At the same time, America's insistence on financing two percent of the gross national product from other NATO members has become very controversial. Karen Bauer reminded that without US nuclear and conventional capability, Germany and Europe cannot protect themselves, and these are unavoidable facts. Most importantly, Europe is a strong partner for the United States and needs protection.

Emmanuel Macron, criticizing Karen Bauer, said that he is skeptical of the idea of ​​European strategic independence. The 42-year-old Macron said with unusual frankness in an interview with the Parisian magazine Grand Continent published on Monday: I think this is a false interpretation of the story. Fortunately, as far as I know, the German chancellor does not follow this line.

[n] در سال‌های گذشته، مسیر بالی بسیار مورد استقبال مسافران قرار گرفته است. هر چند هنوز به دلیل عدم وجود پرواز مستقیم از ایران به این مقصد و به سبب آن، بالا بودن قیمت تورهای بالی، تعداد کسانی‌که تصمیم و علاقه‌ی خود برای سفر به این جزیره را عملی می‌کنند، بسیار زیاد نیست. اما در مقایسه با ۵ یا ۶ سال قبل که کمتر کسی بالی را به عنوان مقصد سفر خود برمی‌گزید، سال‌های اخیر، انتخاب تور بالی یکی از آرزوهای هر مسافر و گردشگری است. باید اعتراف کنیم که اگر قیمت تور بالی، حتی با تایلند هم قابل مقایسه بود، بسیاری این مقصد را برای سفر خود برمی‌گزیدند. [n] اما چرا این میزان از استقبال از این جزیره، رخ داده است؟ در درجه‌ی اول آن‌که، بالی یک مقصد خانوادگی‌ست و همین سبب می‌شود به نسبت بسیاری از شهرهای تایلند، بیشتر مورد انتخاب واقع شود. در جهت بعدی آن که تنوع جاذبه‌های گردشگری آن بسیار زیاد است. شاید این امر در تایلند هم وجود داشته باشد اما شما باید بین نوع جاذبه‌ها انتخاب کنید، مثلا برای دیدن مکان‌های تاریخی فرهنگی باید به شمال تایلند بروید که دیگر ساحلی وجود ندارد. اما بالی این‌گونه نیست و تمامی انواع این جاذبه‌ها، در یک جزیره مجتمع شده‌اند که این کمک می‌کند تا مسافران، از همه‌ی آن‌ها، در یک پکیج امکان استفاده را داشته باشند. مهم‌تر از این، می‌توان به دنج و خلوت بودن این جزیره هم اشاره کرد، چیزی که احتمالا در مسیری نظیر تایلند، به راحتی و سهولت به دست نمی‌آید. در برخی مناطق بالی، خلوتی و دنجی به گونه‌ای‌ست که فقط هتل‌های لوکس ۵ ستاره وجود دارند و شما و مهمانان دیگر هتل‌ها در آن مکان حضور دارید و عملا می‌توانید هفته‌ای را به دور از استرس و هیاهو، بهک استراحت بی‌نظیر بپردازید. [n] تورهای نوروزی بالی، با دو نوع پرواز برنامه‌ریزی شده‌اند، اول پرواز ماهان به مقصد کوالالامپور و از آن‌جا، انتقال به بالی، با یکی از ایرلاین‌های منطقه، دوم ایرلاین قطر که با یک توقف در دوحه، به بالی خواهد رسید. باید دقت کنید که اختلاف قیمت این دو نوع، بسیار زیاد است و برای همین عمده‌ی تمرکز ما در آژانس آویسا بر روی پروازهای ماهان خواهد بود. مدت زمان تورهای این مسیر نیز به صورت ۷ شب و ۸ روز برنامه‌ریزی شده است و مسافران می‌توانند، بهترین زمان را برای سفر نوروزی خود انتخاب کرده و پس از تماس با کارشناسان ما در آژانس آویسا، بسته‌ی تور بالی نوروز ۹۹ خود را خریداری کنند.

[n] وی افزود: هدف از برگزار چنین همایش‌هایی کمک به رونق اقتصاد شهری، پویایی و توسعه همه جانبه شهر با مشارکت مردم و سرمایه گذاران بخش خصوصی است، چراکه براساس نظر کارشناسان همه شهرهای توسعهافته جهان به‌طور معمول برای رسیدن به رشد و توسعه پایدار و بلندمدت اقتصادی، بسترهای لازم را برای سرمایه‌گذاری مناسب فراهم کرده‌اند. [n] شهردار باغبادران با بیان اینکه ورود سرمایه‌ و سرمایه‌گذاران به شهرهای مختلف، تابع امنیت سرمایه‌گذاری است، تصریح کرد: ایجاد ثبات و امنیت سرمایه گذاری، کنترل و کاهش بوروکراسی اداری، کاهش هزینه‌ها و همچنین آموزش نیروهای متخصص از جمله مسایلی است که می‌تواند زمینه ساز حضور سرمایه گذاران بخش خصوصی در پروژه‌های شهرداری‌ها باشد از این رو برگزاری اینگونه کارگاه‌ها می‌تواند همکاری و هماهنگی مناسب را در راستای حذف موانع از سر راه سرمایه گذاری را تقویت کند تا بتوانیم از ظرفیت سرمایه گذاران جهت رونق شهر و شهروندان استفاده کنیم. [n] وی با بیان اینکه شهرداری باغبادران زمینه حضور سرمایه گذاران و صاحبان ایده را در این شهر هموار کرده است، ادامه داد: امروز شرایط و زمینه‌های مناسب برای حضور و جذب سرمایه گذاران در شهرهای مختلف استان از جمله باغبادران کاملا فراهم بوده و نگاه شهرداری نیز به این امر مثبت و واقع بینانه است، از این رو تلاش شده با معرفی فرصت‌های سرمایه گذاری در این شهر امنیت بازگشت سرمایه برای سرمایه گذاران تبیین شود چراکه در صورت نبود این مهم هیچ فرد عاقلی حاضر به سمت سرمایه گذاری در شهرها حرکت نمی‌کند و در هیچ جای دنیا هیچ کس حاضر به سرمایه گذاری ریسک پذیر نیست. [n] محمدی با بیان اینکه کاهش بروکراسی اداری تاثیر بسیار فراونی در جذب سرمایه گذار و اجرای پروژه‌ها خواهد داشت، اضافه کرد: شهرداری و شورای اسلامی باغبادران با استفاده از ظرفیت مشاوران زبده، فرصت‌های جدید را شناسایی و سرمایه گذاران معرفی کند، اما در این مسیر باید به گونه‌ای عمل شود که استعلامات مورد نیز در کوتاه‌ترین زمان ممکن صورت گرفته و آنرا تبدیل به مجوز کنیم چراکه مراحل اداری پیچیده، فراوان و موازی از دلایل مهم وخامت وضعیت شهرداری‌ها در مولفه‌های کسب درآمد پایدار است.

[n] شهردار باغبادران خاطرنشان کرد: امروز شهرداران برای هماهنگی انجام یک پروژه عمرانی باید با تمامی سازمان‌ها و نهادها مذاکره کرده و انرژی خود را صرف انجام مسایلی چون اخذ مجوز و … کنند و امیدورایم با قرار گرفتن پروژه‌ها و فرصت‌های سرمایه گذاری شهرداری‌ها بر روی درگاه سرمایه گذاری استانداری اصفهان این دغدغه مهم از میان برداشته شود.

[n] وی گفت: متخصصان و کارگرانی که در این منطقه عظیم صنعتی و اقتصادی کار می‌کنند باید به نقش خود در اقتصاد کشور ببالند و همه با هم در کنار یکدیگر باید تلاش کنیم در جنگ نابرابر اقتصادی آمریکا پیروز شویم. [n] مشاور رئیس جمهوری و دبیر شورای عالی مناطق ویژه و اقتصادی ادامه داد: همین فعالیتی که در این منطقه ویژه صنعتی انجام شده است به تنهایی کارنامه خوبی برای ایران است، اما متاسفانه مردم و حتی برخی مسئولان به خوبی از این تلاش‌ها آگاه نیستند. [n] بانک افزود: نخستین بار است که در اقتصاد کشور تولید و صادرات غیر نفتی ما از صادرات نفتی پیشی می‌گیرد و بخش عظیمی از آن از مناطق ویژه و آزاد انجام می‌شود؛ در بین مناطق ویژه و آزاد کشور جایگاه منطقه ویژه پارس ویژه است زیرا ۱۷ میلیارد دلار از ۴۵ میلیارد دلار صادرات کشور از این منطقه انجام می‌شود. [n] وی تصریح کرد: منطقه ویژه پارس الگوی خوبی است تا به برخی منتقدان تشکیل مناطق آزاد و ویژه در کشور ثابت شود که این مناطق افزون بر تسهیلات سرمایه‌گذاری، نقش پررنگی نیز در اقتصاد کشور ایفا می‌کنند به‌طوری که تا کنون ۲۰۰ میلیارد دلار در این منطقه سرمایه‌گذاری شده و این مهم در سایه قوانین مناطق آزاد و ویژه تسهیل شده است. [n] لزوم اطلاع‌رسانی درباره فعالیت‌های عظیم در منطقه پارس جنوبی [n] دبیر شورای عالی مناطق ویژه و اقتصادی افزود: باید واقعیت کار عظیمی که در پارس جنوبی انجام شده است بهتر به رسانه‌ها و نمایندگان مردم و حتی مسئولان کشور منتقل کنیم. اذعان می‌کنم در این زمینه ضعیف عمل کرده‌ایم، به همین دلیل است که امروز برخی به نقش مناطق ویژه و آزاد در اقتصاد کشور خرده می‌گیرند. [n] بانک ادامه داد: هم‌اکنون نزدیک به نیم میلیون نفر در مناطق آزاد و ویژه کشور فعال هستند و اقتصاد کشور به لطف این مناطق جهش مناسبی در زمینه صادرات غیر نفتی پیدا کرده است و تنها ۷٫۵ میلیارد دلار واردات از این مناطق در مقابل ۴۵ میلیارد صادرات انجام شده که این موضوع بسیار قابل توجه است. [n] وی یادآور شد بحث افزایش عوارض گمرکی به ۲۰ درصد در مناطق آزاد و ویژه به‌زودی ابلاغ می‌شود که این مسئله گام مهمی در بحث خود کفایی درآمدی مناطق آزاد و ویژه اقتصادی ایفا می‌کند.

[n] وی تصریح کرد: ایستادن بر قله پیشرفت در قطب صنعتی ایران مرهون تلاش و همت کارکنان صنعت نفت و بهره‌گیری از توان متخصصان داخلی در بهره‌برداری از پروژه‌های بزرگ است. [n] مدیرعامل سازمان منطقه ویژه اقتصادی انرژی پارس ادامه داد: رویکرد وزارت نفت توسعه صنایع پایین‌دستی پتروشیمی و ایجاد ارزش افزوده از طریق توسعه زنجیره تولید در این صنعت است تا ضمن جلوگیری از خام فروشی برای کشور نیز درآمدزایی داشته باشد. [n] موسوی عملکرد این سازمان در حوزه مسئولیت‌های اجتماعی به‌ویژه در زمینه اشتغال، ایجاد و توسعه زیرساخت‌ها در محیط پیرامونی و توجه به مسائل آموزشی و فرهنگی به‌ویژه طرح نخبه‌پروری و آموزش کارجویان در مراکز آموزش فنی‌وحرفه‌ای را گامی مهم و امید آفرین در میان مردم این منطقه عنوان کرد و گفت: انجام اقدام‌های اصلاحی مربوط به مسائل زیست محیطی طرح‌های پتروشیمی و پالایشی از دیگر مطالبات مردم در بخش محیط زیست بوده است که این موارد نیز از سوی مدیریت ارشد بهداشت، ایمنی و محیط زیست (HSE) منطقه ویژه پارس به‌طور جدی نظارت و پیگیری خواهد شد.",

OPEC, which is ostensibly made up of the world's biggest oil exporters, is set to re-admit Jakarta, now that the country has been more of an importer than an exporter of the black gold for the past decade. [n] In a statement released by OPEC this week on Indonesia's re-membership, Indonesia has contributed greatly to OPEC's history. We welcome the return of this country to the organization. [n] Many analysts wonder why OPEC members agreed to the entry of an importer into the organization? Some have said that this move shows the organization's inability to maintain its influence in the global oil market, but others say that OPEC is evolving. [n] He said: Globalization has caused changes in the oil industry, and OPEC is at the center of these changes. [n] Undoubtedly, exerting control over the international oil market will continue to be one of the welcome outcomes of Indonesia's membership in OPEC. [n] Many experts say that Saudi Arabia still has a lot of room to work in the Asian market. Regional stability in Asia, where OPEC can benefit from its growing market for refined products, could be very attractive to the organization in the long term. Ultimately, it would be in OPEC's interest to bring Indonesia back into the region to bring economic stability to the region. Despite being an oil importer, Jakarta can play an important role in the global oil market. [n] Indonesia also contains the Straits of Malacca, which is expected to increase oil transit shipments through the region as demand increases in Asia. Indonesia's return to OPEC gives the organization more control over oil exports from major producers to major consumers. [n] Some analysts believe that an increase in Indonesian oil production in a market that is already facing an oversupply could cause prices to fall further, but this is not what the organization is looking for. [n] Indonesia's new membership in OPEC can also be a message from the organization to the world that members are willing to continue trading in this industry and developing their markets despite low prices.

    "input": "به گزارش سرویس ترجمه ایمنا، ماری اسکلودوسکا کوری (Marie Sklofowska Curie)، یک زن دانشمند لهستانی الاصل با نام شناسنامه‌ای Maria Salomea بود. ماری در تاریخ هفت نوامبر ۱۸۶۷ در ورشو لهستان چشم به جهان گشود. تفاوت در نام کوچک به این دلیل است که ماری بعد از مهاجرت به فرانسه، تلفظ فرانسوی نام خود (از ماریا به ماری) را پذیرفت. ماری کوری در مراحل مختلف زندگی بانویی فوق العاده بود، از این رو نوشتن و سخن گفتن از او حتی در قالب کتاب هم نمی‌گنجد. اما برای آشنایی بیشتر و یادآوری به قدرت و استعداد نهفته در نهاد زنان، اشاره‌ای کوتاه به زندگی شخصی و حرفه‌ای این بانوی تاریخ ساز می‌کنیم. [n] نوجوانی پرفراز و نشیب ماری [n] پدر ماری معلم فیزیک و ریاضی بود و مادرش نیز معلم بود. زندگی ماری مانند بسیاری از دانشمندان و انسان‌های موفق دیگر شامل فراز و نشیب‌های بسیاری بود. او مادرش را در سن ۱۰ سالگی از دست داد و پدرش به دلیل یک سرمایه گذاری اشتباه تمام پس انداز خود را از دست داد. به همین دلیل ماری مجبور بود در کنار تحصیل کار هم بکند. او از کارهایی که انجام می‌داد پس اندازی برای خود جمع می‌کرد و بخشی از آن را به خواهرش داد تا در فرانسه در رشته علوم پزشکی تحصیل کند. [n] ماری روزها به کارکردن به عنوان پرستار آموزگار در یک خانه مشغول به کار بود و شب‌ها به مطالعه فیزیک، شیمی و ریاضی می‌پرداخت. او همچنین در کلاس‌های درس و سخنرانی‌هایی که به صورت رایگان در یک کتابخانه لهستانی برگزار می‌شد شرکت می‌کرد. اما بعد از مدتی به دلیل مخالفت با حضور و تحصیل زنان در جامعه لهستان، از حضور ماری در کلاس‌ها و مراسم نیز ممانعت شد. [n] اخذ مدرک فیزیک و شیمی از دانشگاه سوربن پاریس [n] به دلیل محدودیت‌های موجود در جامعه لهستان، ماری در سال ۱۸۹۱ به پاریس مهاجرت کرد و در رشته فیزیک در دانشگاه سوربن پاریس مشغول به تحصیل شد. کلاس‌ها به زبان فرانسه برگزار می‌شد به همین دلیل ماری مجبور بود این زبان را به سرعت فراگیرد. او آپارتمانی در نزدیکی دانشگاه کرایه کرده بود که وضعیت مناسبی نداشت به همین دلیل زندگی به خصوص در فصول سرد سال، زندگی طاقت فرسایی را به او تحمیل می‌کرد. زبان جدید و همچنین شرایط دشوار زندگی در پاریس نه تنها مانع پیشرفت ماری نشد بلکه به او انگیزه‌ای در جهت تحقق رویاهایش می‌بخشید. او در سال ۱۸۹۳ و در سن ۲۶ سالگی به عنوان دانشجوی برتر، موفق به دریافت مدرک کارشناسی فیزیک شد. ماری، این بانوی خستگی ناپذیر یک سال بعد نیز موفق به دریافت مدرک کارشناسی ارشد شیمی از همان دانشگاه شد و سپس تحصیلات خود را تا مقطع دکتری ادامه داد. [n] ازدواج ماری با دانشمند معروف و تحقیق بر اورانیوم [n] در سال ۱۸۹۵ ماری با پیر کوری (Pierre Curie) ازدواج کرد. در آن زمان پیر ۳۶ سال داشت و در حالی که به تازگی مدرک دکتری خود را دریافت کرده بود در دانشگاه تدریس می‌کرد. او دانشمندی شناخته شده و قابل احترام بود. در سن ۲۱ سالگی به همراه برادرش جک، مفهوم پیزوالکتریسیته را کشف کرده بود. تجربه و سابقه او در شاخه مغناطیس باعث کشف مهمی شد که امروزه به نام «نقطه کوری (Curie Point)» شناخته می‌شود. این نقطه دمایی است که مواد مغناطیسی در آن خاصیت مغناطیسی خود را از دست می‌دهند و بهک مغناطیس القایی تبدیل می‌شوند. [n] ماری پس از ازدواج به تحقیق بر روی مطالعات خود در زمینه دکتری مشغول بود. او برای تحقیقات خود عنصر اورانیوم را انتخاب کرده بود. همسر ماری پیگیر تحقیقات او بود و به دستاوردها و زمینه کاری ماری علاقمند شده بود. آنها با یکدیگر همکاری دوستانه‌ای در تمام مسائل زندگی و کاری داشتند تا جایی که ماری درباره رابطه‌شان گفته است: «من و همسرم به دلیل روابط صمیمانه و کارهای مشترک بینمان، به قدری با همدیگر متحد بودیم که تقریبا تمام زمان خود را با هم سپری می‌کردیم.» [n] کشف پلونیوم و رادیوم [n] ماری و پیر تمرکز خود را به کشف و تحقیق بر روی عناصر دیگر معطوف کردند. اولین عنصر کشف شده پلونیوم نام داشت. ماری این نام را به خاطر احترام به وطن خود (Poland) انتخاب کرده بود. این زوج در تحقیقات خود به این نتیجه رسیدند که پلونیوم ۳۰۰ برابر بیشتر از اورانیوم پرتو ساطع می‌کند. دومین عنصری که توسط ماری و همسرش کشف شد اورانیوم نام گرفت. آنها نام این عنصر را از روی نام لاتین کلمه پرتو (Ray) انتخاب کردند و کشف کردند که رادیوم چندین میلیون برابر بیشتر از اورانیوم رادیواکتیویته دارد. درواقع رادیواکتیویتی (Radioactivity) یا پرتو افشانی اصطلاحی است که پیر و ماری برای قدرت تشعشع عناصری مانند اورانیوم، پلونیوم و رادیوم در نظر گرفتند و از آن در کاربردهای پزشکی و درمانی استفاده می‌کردند. [n] ماری کوری؛ اولین زن موفق به دریافت دو جایزه نوبل [n] ماری کوری در ژوئن ۱۹۰۳ مدرک دکتری خود را در رشته فیزیک دریافت کرد. داوران معتقد بودند که او بزرگترین تاثیر علمی تاریخ را در پایان نامه دکتری خود به جا گذاشته است. شش ماه بعد او به عنوان اولین زن، موفق به دریافت جایزه نوبل شد. درواقع، اولین و تا به حال تنها کسی که در طول زندگی خود در دو رشته متفاوت، دو جایزه نوبل به نامش ثبت شده، کسی نبوده جز ماری کوری! او اولین جایزه نوبل را در رشته فیزیک و دومی را در رشته شیمی دریافت کرد. همچنین ماری کوری اولین زن بود که کرسی استادی در دانشگاه پاریس را به دست آورد. موفقیت وی شامل نظریه رادیواکتیویته (اصطلاحی که خودش ابداع کرد) بود. این نظریه شامل روش هایی برای جداسازی ایزوتوپ و کشف دو عنصر پلونیوم و رادیوم است. مطالعات ماری کوری بر روی از بین بردن تومورها از طریق ایزوتوپ‌های رادیواکتیو متمرکز بود. وی دو مرکز پزشکی را، در پاریس و ورشو که امروزه از مراکز عظیم پزشکی هستند، با نام کوری تاسیس کرد. همچنین در جنگ جهانی اول، اولین مرکز درمانی رادیو پزشکی را نیز تاسیس کرد. [n] ماری تمام عمر و سلامتی خود را وقف علم کرد تا سرانجام در سال ۱۹۳۴ در سن ۶۶ سالگی دیده از جهان فروبست. دلیل مرگ او کم خونی آپلاستیک، به دلیل تماس با مواد رادیو اکتیو بود. کتاب‌ها و نوشته‌های ماری نیز حاوی رادیواکتیو هستند به همین دلیل آنها را در جعبه‌های مخصوص نگهداری می‌کنند. در جنگ جهانی اول بیش از یک میلیون سرباز توسط دستگاه‌های این دانشمند تحت عکاسی پزشکی قرار گرفتند. تمام فداکاری‌ها، از جان گذشتگی‌ها وخدمات ماری کوری، این دانشمند خستگی ناپذیر در تاریخ علمی و پزشکی، برای همیشه ثبت شده است.

    "input": "به گزارش بازار به نقل از ایبنا، چند ماه اخیر، با تشدید فشارها از سوی دولت دونالد ترامپ بر اقتصاد ایران، وضعیت بازار ارزی و به تبع آن قیمت کالاها و خدمات دچار آسیب شده و با چند شوک قیمتی همراه بود. از این رو، بانک مرکزی با اتخاذ سیاست‌های جدید بلافاصله وارد عمل شد تا جو روانی حاکم بر بازارها را آرام کند. این نهاد، به طور روزانه میلیون‌ها دلار ارز را در اختیار بازار قرار داد تا به مصارف وارداتی کشور برسد. اما در این بین، بازار ملتهب از اخبار مختلف در کنار سودجویی عده‌ای خاص، باعث نوسانات در قیمت کالاهای اساسی می‌شد. [n] این روزها در بسیاری از فروشگاه‌های کوچک و بزرگ قیمت اجناس با برچسب روی آنها متفاوت است. کارشناسان دلیل این امر را در بعضی موارد عمدی و در بعضی موارد ناشی از توجیهات تولیدکنندگان و عرضه‌کنندگان برای افزایش قیمت تمام شده کالاها می‌دانند. همه اینها در حالی است که ارز به مقدار کافی عرضه شده و بانک مرکزی بر سیاست‌های ضدتورمی متمرکز است و آن را اولویت خود عنوان می‌کند. [n] علی دینی ترکمانی، اقتصاددان و استاد دانشگاه در این‌باره اقدامات بانک مرکزی برای صرفه‌جویی در مصارف ارزی را مثبت ارزیابی کرد و گفت: صرفه‌جویی ارز به گونه‌ای که باید انجام می‌گرفت، انجام گرفته است و در کنار مصارفی که خارج از اختیارات بانک مرکزی است، آنچه مربوط به صرفه‌جویی ارزی در حوزه وارادات مواد اولیه و کالاهای اساسی است تقریبا موفقیت‌آمیز بوده است. [n] وی با تاکید بر اینکه این روند باید ادامه‌دار باشد، اضافه کرد: برای مثال، در چنین سیاستی، ارز گردشگری را می‌توان کمتر کرد و یا تخصیص‌های یارانه‌ای که قبلا به کالاهای زیادی داده می‌شد، محدود کرد و با نظارت بر مصرف ارزهای تخصیص داده شده به کالاهای ضروری مثل مواد غذایی و دارو اهمیت بیشتری داد. [n] دینی ترکمانی خاطرنشان کرد: ما چیزی حول و حوش ۱۵ هزار میلیارد دلار واردات مواد غذایی و دارو و یک سری کالاهای استراتژیک دیگر داریم که اینها اگر وارد نشوند در داخل کمبود ایجاد می‌شود، بنابراین برای مدیریت این حجم از واردات، راهی جز تخصیص ارز دولتی با نظارت بانک مرکزی به این موارد وجود ندارد. [n] این استاد دانشگاه با بیان اینکه الان مسئله این نیست که مصرف کالاها را فشرده و محدود کنیم، گفت: مسئله اصلی مدیریت منابع ارزی در راستای مصارف درست و منطقی است. چرا که در همین حدی هم که کالای اساسی و دارو باید وارد شود به هر حال مشکلاتی وجود دارد و اخلال‌هایی به وجود می‌آید که باید جلوی آنها گرفته شود. [n] توجیه تولیدکنندگان برای گرانی کالاها اما در کنار اقدامات بانک مرکزی، نظارت بر توزیع کالاها با قیمت متعادل امری است که باید دستگاه‌های مسئول در وزارت صمت و قوه قضائیه از جمله سازمان حمایت از مصرف‌کنندگان و گشت‌های تعزیرات به آن ورود کنند. [n] دینی ترکمانی با اشاره به این موضوع که علاوه بر تخصیص ارز، نوع توزیع کالاها و خدمات در داخل نیز بر قیمت‌ها تاثیر می‌گذارد، تصریح کرد: در بخش توزیع کالاها این احتمال وجود دارد که اختلال توسط خود عرضه‌کنندگان به خصوص از سوی طرف‌های داخلی رخ بدهد برای آنکه قیمت‌ها بالا برود. [n] وی دلیل تاثیر عرضه‌کنندگان بر قیمت‌ها را توضیح داد و افزود: دلیل این است که ما همه عرضه داخلی‌مان از محل واردات نیست، مثلا ما گندم و یا روغن نباتی در داخل تولید می‌کنیم و دانه‌های روغنی را وارد می‌کنیم و یا برخی از داروها تولید داخل و برخی دیگر وارداتی است. [n] عضو هیات علمی موسسه مطالعات و پژوهش‌های بازرگانی یادآور شد: ‌ پس ما هم تولید داخلی و هم واردات داریم. حالا ممکن است قیمت اقلامی مثل روغن نباتی و نظایر اینها دچار اختلال شود در حالی که ربطی هم به مسئله واردات نداشته باشد و موجودی انبارها به اندازه کافی باشد اما تولیدکنندگان برای افزایش قیمت احتمالا خودشان باعث بروز کمبود در بازار می‌شوند تا قیمت بالا برود و آن چیزی که مد نظرشان است محقق شود. البته گویا آنها هم احتمالا این استدلال را دارند که در قیمت‌های فعلی دچار زیان می‌شوند و قیمت‌ها را باید بالا ببرند. [n] وی تاثیر تصمیمات داخلی بر قیمت‌ها را حائز اهمیت دانست و اضافه کرد: برای مثال، حتی کاری که خودروسازها انجام می‌دهند که با شورای رقابت و دولت چانه‌زنی و مذاکره می‌کنند برای آنکه قیمت درب کارخانه خودرو را بالا ببرند، در اینجا هم این احتمال وجود دارد که بخشی از تولیدات شامل ارز یارانه‌ای باشد. [n] دینی ترکمانی با بیان این احتمالات در حوزه مصارف ارزی تاکید کرد: ‌ به هر حال، تمام این‌ها نشانه جدی از مسئله تحریم‌ها است که از آن طرف اجازه نمی‌دهد که با واردات در حد قابل توجه و به راحتی عرضه محصولات در بازارها شفاف و تنظیم شود تا اگر تولیدکننده داخلی کم‌کاری کرد و بازی درآورد و روی قیمت‌ها دست‌درازی کرد از طریق واردات بتوان جواب آن را سریع داد. [n] این اقتصاددان اضافه کرد: البته از یاد نبریم، از آن طرف هم خود هزینه‌های تولید داخلی تولیدکننده‌ها هم با افزایش نرخ دلار و تورم افزایش پیدا کرده و ممکن است آنها هم به نوعی کارشان منطقی به نظر برسد هرچند از نظر اخلاقی شاید قابل فهم نباشد. در اینجا هم نظارت شرط مهمی است چرا که کافی است کهک تولیدکننده عنوان کند تولید ندارد و محصول را در سیستم پخش، توزیع نمی‌کند. چنین اقداماتی می‌تواند شوک را در بازار ایجاد کند و قیمت را بالا ببرد و این ربطی به نرخ ارز و بانک مرکزی ندارد. [n] دینی ترکمانی در پایان گفت: اما آنچه با قطعیت می‌توان گفت این است که تاکنون تمام تلاش‌ها برای صرفه‌جویی ارزی رخ داده و اتفاقات موثری صورت گرفته است. اما کمی منصفانه اگر نگاه کنیم این ارزی که برای واردات کالاهای اساسی و دارو مصرف می‌شود پایین‌ترین مقدار ارز مورد نیاز است که حالا اگر درآمدهای نفتی و سایر درآمدها کفاف اینها را نکند، فشارها بیشتر هم می‌شود.",

[n] در ابتدای این نشست حمیدرضا فولادگر، رئیس شورای راهبری بهبود محیط کسب‌وکار ضمن معرفی این شورا که توسط ۳ اتاق تاسیس شده و هدف از ایجاد آن، استفاده از قوانین و ساختارهای موجود برای استفاده بیشتر از ظرفیت بخش خصوصی با رویکرد بهبود محیط کسب‌وکار و اجرای صحیح سیاست‌های کلی اصل ۴۴ قانون اساسی است، به عنوان‌های مشترک مورد بحث با معاون قوه قضائیه اشاره کرد [n] این عنوان‌ها عبارت بودند از مسائل مربوط به هیات داوری خصوصی‌سازی، دادگاه‌های استجازی ویژه مفاسد اقتصادی، لایحه آیین دادرسی تجاری و تشکیل دادگاه ویژه تجاری موضوع ماده ۲۹ قانون بهبود مستمر محیط کسب‌وکار، نحوه تعامل بین بخش خصوصی و قوه قضائیه در خصوص اصلاح لایحه تجارت، اصلاح و ارتقای شاخص‌های کسب‌وکار و در نهایت موضوع اجازه مجدد تبدیل شرکت‌ها که توسط لعیا جنیدی، معاون حقوقی ریاست جمهوری در هیات وزیران مطرح و مصوب شد و آیین‌نامه آن هم تنظیم شد اما سازمان ثبت اسناد و املاک کشور آن را اجرا نمی‌کند. [n] محمدباقر الفت، معاون اجتماعی و پیشگیری از وقوع جرم قوه قضائیه ضمن نگاهی به آنچه در راستای خصوصی‌سازی انجام شد، نبود تجربه و اعتقاد واقعی به این موضوع را علت اصلی عدم موفقیت در خصوصی‌سازی برشمرد. [n] به باور او تاخیر ۳۰ ساله در آغاز فرآیند خصوصی‌سازی موجب شد تا تعداد قابل توجهی از شرکت‌ها با اعمال مدیریت دولتی به تدریج ضعیف و ضعیف‌تر شوند تا جایی که امروز چیزی جز سهام این شرکت‌ها برای واگذاری باقی نماند. در این شرایط نباید انتظار داشت که روند خصوصی‌سازی با موفقیت طی شود. [n] وی این نکته را نیز مورد توجه قرار داد که بدون شک تغییر در سیستم اقتصادی هر کشور با هزینه و پیچیدگی‌های زیادی اتفاق می‌افتد. بنابراین اگر مایل به این تغییر هستیم باید هزینه آن را هم بپردازیم. [n] معاون اجتماعی قوه قضائیه از بررسی پرونده‌های متعدد درباره خصوصی‌سازی به شیوه داوری که شرایط خاص خود را دارد سخن گفت و علت استفاده از داوری در این‌گونه پرونده‌ها را سرعت دادن به روند بررسی‌ها دانست و تاکید کرد: متاسفانه بالا رفتن تعداد پرونده‌ها و پیچیدگی‌های حقوقی موجود در آنها باعث شده تا سرعت بررسی حتی به شیوه داوری نیز کند شود. قوه قضائیه می‌داند که سرعت عمل در مباحث اقتصادی اهمیت بالایی دارد چراکه طولانی شدن فرایند بررسی‌ها موجب می‌شود در شرکت‌ها نابه سامانی رخ دهد. امروز یکی از معضلات جدی کشور رسیدگی به همین پرونده‌هاست. [n] او در بخش دیگری از سخنان خود یادآور شد: هدف از واگذاری‌ها به هیچ‌وجه مال فروشی نیست و نبوده بلکه با این کار می‌خواهیم ناکارآمدی‌ها را از بین ببریم و روند توسعه را بهبود ببخشیم. [n] الفت همچنین به موضوع دادگاه‌های ویژه رسیدگی به جرائم اقتصادی اشاره و تصریح کرد: زمانی که فساد در کشورها افزایش پیدا کند به ناچار باید دادگاه‌هایی شکل بگیرند که به صورت جدی و قاطع با این جرائم برخورد کنند. در این دادگاه، دادرسی‌ها توسط قضات خاصی انجام می‌شود و احکام صادر شده توسط آنها به غیر از حکم اعدام، قطعی است. از طرفی وکیل‌های خاصی می‌توانند روی این پرونده‌ها کار کنند و امکان تخفیف، تعلیق مجازات و چنین اقداماتی وجود ندارد. [n] بر اساس اظهارات او در مدتی که این دادگاه‌ها فعالیت داشتند نقدهایی هم به آنها وارد شد و زمانی که مهلت تعیین شده برای فعالیت آنها به پایان رسید با موافقت رهبری قرار شد همچنان به فعالیت ادامه دهند البته با چند مورد اصلاح؛ دادگاه باید وکیل منتخب متهم را بپذیرد و مکانیسم اعاده دادرسی نیز پذیرفته شود. [n] معاون اجتماعی قوه قضائیه همچنین به تاکید رهبری درباره ایجاد دادگاه‌های تجاری اشاره و تاکید کرد: برای راه‌اندازی چنین دادگاه‌هایی لازم است ابتدا بسترهای آن فراهم شود. نکته اول در این باره تصویب قانون ماهیتی در حوزه تجارت است که کلیه مفاهیم و موضوعات این حوزه را پوشش دهد و قابل استناد باشد؛ نوع قراردادها، اعمال تجاری، معرفی تاجر، انواع شرکت‌ها، نوع تاسیس و اداره آنها را معرفی کند. از سوی دیگر درباره ادغام، تبدیل، انحلال، ورشکستگی، روابط سهام‌داران و غیره را نیز تشریح کند. در هر حال این قانون باید جامعیت لازم را داشته باشد. [n] وی ادامه داد: بعد از موضوع قانون به آیین دادرسی تجاری نیاز داریم و لازم است در این بین چند تاجر خبره و با تجربه به عنوان مشاور در کنار قاضی حضور داشته باشند که در حال حاضر چنین رویه‌ای در سیستم دادرسی ما تعریف نشده است. نکته بعدی نیاز به قضاتی است که دانش‌آموخته حقوق اقتصادی باشند که همچنان در دانشگاه‌های ما این موضوع تدریس نمی‌شود. [n] طبق گفته الفت با توجه به تاکید رهبری و حکم ماده ۲۹ قانون بهبود مستمر محیط کسب‌وکار اقدامات اولیه‌ای صورت گرفته تا در شعبات حل اختلاف و دادرسی‌های سراسر کشور امکان بررسی پرونده‌های مربوط به حوزه تجارت فراهم شود. [n] وی در ادامه به موضوع امکان تبدیل شرکت‌ها و مصوبه هیات وزیران در این رابطه بر اساس پیگیری‌های شورای گفت‌وگو و تهیه دستورالعملی در این مورد که تا مرحله ابلاغ نیز پیش رفت اشاره و تاکید کرد: این دستورالعمل با همکاری معاونت حقوقی رئیس‌جمهور و سازمان ثبت اسناد و املاک کشور نوشته شد اما پس از اتمام کار، سازمان ثبت مدعی شد بر اساس قانون، تهیه دستورالعمل به عهده قوه قضائیه بوده و نه قوه مجریه، در نتیجه امکان ابلاغ و اجرا ندارد. [n] الفت افزود: پس از دریافت نظر رئیس قوه قضائیه و تاکید ایشان بر عمل به قانون، دستورالعمل تهیه شده را به صورت دادخواست برای ابطال به دیوان عدالت اداری فرستادند. [n] در ادامه این نشست جعفر مرعشی، نماینده اتاق ایران در شورای راهبری بهبود محیط کسب‌وکار راهکار اجرای موفق خصوصی‌سازی در کشور را فرهنگ‌سازی و تبدیل مفهوم ایجاد ثروت و تولید را بهک ارزش در جامعه دانست و تاکید کرد: تا زمانی که این بستر فرهنگی و فکری در سطح جامعه شکل نگیرد نمی‌توان از بخش خصوصی، تولیدکنندگان و تجار حمایت واقعی کرد. [n] هوشیار فقیهی، معاون اقتصادی اتاق اصناف نیز ایجاد شفافیت و امنیت اقتصادی را خواسته و انتظار بخش خصوصی از قوه قضائیه برشمرد و تاکید کرد: خیلی مهم است که در یک جامعه کارآفرین، تولیدکننده و تاجر با احساس امنیت فعالیت کند. آن‌ها باید باور کنند که در جامعه فعالیت‌های واسطه گرایانه که بدون تلاش و کار صورت می‌گیرند، مورد حمایت نیستند. [n] همچنین محمد قاسمی، رئیس مرکز پژوهش‌های اتاق ایران از آمادگی این مرکز برای همکاری با قوه قضائیه در راستای اجرای مطالعات کارشناسی درباره مسائل و موضوعات خاص خبر داد و در ادامه محمدباقر مجتبائی مشاور اقتصادی و برنامه‌ریزی اتاق اصناف مشکل اصلی در حوزه اقتصاد را اجرای نامناسب قوانین و مقررات عنوان کرد و با انتقاد از بی‌توجهی نسبت به کارنامه کاری مدیران در بخش‌های مختلف، خاطرنشان کرد: مدیران کشور بدون توجه به کارنامه کاری آنها از یک پست به پست دیگری منتقل می‌شوند. برای همین است که نمی‌توانیم در حل مشکلات موجود به درستی تصمیم گرفته و اقدام کنیم. [n] رضا وفائی، معاون اقتصادی و امور بین‌الملل اتاق تعاون درباره واگذاری‌ها و آنچه در این وادی انجام گرفته گفت: زمانی که واگذاری‌ها فقط مالکیت‌ها واگذار شد و نه مدیریت بنابراین بخش زیادی از مشکلات همچنان ادامه داشت. [n] به اعتقاد او زمانی که بخش خصوصی وارد عمل شود، شفافیت نیز شکل می‌گیرد و همین شفافیت کمک می‌کند تا نظارت‌ها نیز واقعی‌تر اتفاق افتد. [n] محمد زائری، دبیر شورای راهبری بهبود محیط کسب‌وکار در انتهای این نشست با تاکید بر قانون و ضرورت استفاده از نظرات مشورتی بخش خصوصی به هنگام تصمیم‌گیری، گفت: از آنجا که اتفاقات کشور به سرعت در حال تغییر است و ستادها و کارگروه‌های متعدد در حال ایجاد است، لازم است سازوکاری اتخاذ شود تا بخش خصوصی نیز در این ستادها حضور پررنگی داشته باشد. [n] در نهایت استفاده از ظرفیت سه اتاق بازرگانی، اصناف و تعاون در اجرای برنامه‌های اقتصادی کشور و حضور آنها در جلسات شوراها و ستادها، دو خواسته‌ای بود که در این نشست مورد تاکید قرار گرفت.",

[n] رئیس سازمان بازرسی کل کشور با اشاره به نقش شورای دستگاه‌های نظارتی در دوران مقابله با تحریم‌ها، تصریح کرد: خوشبختانه با مصوبه مجمع تشخیص مصلحت نظام، شورای دستگاه‌های نظارتی کشور دائمی شد و با ترکیب جدید و با جدیت تشکیل جلسه می‌دهد و می‌تواند در شرایط تحریم کمک حال دستگاه‌های اجرایی باشد. [n] عضو شورای‌ عالی قوه‌ قضاییه حمایت از دستگاه‌های اجرایی، به خصوص دستگاه‌های پرریسک مانند بانک‌ها و دیگر نهادهای تصمیم‌گیر در حوزه مالی را یکی از رویکردهای جدی سازمان بازرسی عنوان کرد و گفت: در شرایط فعلی اگر مدیری ریسک نکند و به موقع تصمیم نگیرد، کشور دچار مشکل می‌شود و ممکن است مدیری پیش خود فکر کند به خاطر ریسکی کهک موضوع دارد، تصمیمی اتخاذ و اقدام نکند تا به دردسر احتمالی نیفتد و به همین‌خاطر حجت الاسلام و المسلمین رئیسی از ما خواسته‌اند که بر ترک فعل‌ها نیز ورود کنیم و ما نیز حتما سراغ مسئولیت‌های انجام نشده خواهیم رفت و مطالبه خواهیم کرد و چه بسا ترک فعل‌ها مهمتر و ضرر آن نیز به کشور بیشتر باشد. [n] حجت‌الاسلام والمسلمین درویشیان بر انجام اقدامات پیشگیرانه و اصلاحی تاکید کرد و افزود: حقیقتا دنبال مچ‌گیری نیستیم و قصد دستگیری از مدیران را داریم، اما در عین حال مچ مفسدین را از جمله مفسدین مالی و اقتصادی، مفسدین اداری و ترک فعل‌ها را می‌گیریم. بعضا عدم توجه به مسئولیت‌ها و ترک فعل‌ها منجر به پرونده‌های فسادی می‌شود که اکنون در قوه‌ قضاییه در حال رسیدگی است. [n] رئیس سازمان بازرسی کل کشور با اشاره به گزارش‌های هشداری این سازمان به دستگاه‌های مختلف از جمله بانک‌ها و تاکید بر بررسی آسیب‌های ساختاری و فرآیندی که منتهی به فساد و ایراد می‌شود، اظهار داشت: از ابتدای انقلاب همه دلسوزان بر اصلاح نظام‌های مختلف از جمله بانکی، مالیاتی، گمرکی و … تاکید کردند که تاکنون اصلاح اساسی صورت نگرفته، اما بنا داریم به کمک مجلس برویم تا اصلاحات اساسی در نظام بانکی صورت بگیرد. [n] وی با اشاره به جلسات مفصل خود و سازمان بازرسی با مدیران بانک مرکزی و بانک‌های عامل، گفت: بنا داریم مشکلات و مسائل کشور را با همفکری و همکاری حل کنیم، نه اینکه چوب لای چرخ دستگاه‌های فعال در خط مقدم مبارزه با تروریسم اقتصادی بگذاریم. [n] ضرورت نظارت بیشتر بانک‌ها بر تسهیلات پرداختی و معوق شدن مطالبات حجت‌الاسلام والمسلمین درویشیان خاطرنشان کرد: یکی از دغدغه‌هایی که در بازرسی از بانک‌های مختلف برای ما ایجاد شد، مسئله نیاز به نظارت بیشتر بانک‌ها بر تسهیلات پرداختی و معوق شدن مطالبات است؛ اینکه بخشی از تسهیلات پرداختی در محلی که در قرارداد ذکر شده، صرف نمی‌شود، به علت عدم نظارت بانک‌هاست، باید نظارت بانک‌ها تقویت شود و تا انتهای زنجیره مصرف تسهیلات در پروژه‌ها ادامهابد و اطمینان حاصل شود که تسهیلات در جای مقرر هزینه شده و ارزیابی‌ها نیز دقیق باشد. [n] رئیس سازمان بازرسی کل کشور با انتقاد از کارشناسی‌های ضعیف و یا بعضا توجه نکردن به گزارش‌های کارشناسان، گفت: برخی از تسهیلاتی که به پروژه‌ها داده می‌شود، اولویت کشور نیست و یا آن پروژه صرفه اقتصادی ندارد، اما بانک‌ها بعضا با فشارهای مقامات سیاسی و غیر سیاسی مجبور به پرداخت می‌شوند، درحالی‌که شما باید امانت‌دار مردم باشید و از منابع بیت‌المال محافظت کنید. [n] وی ادامه داد: در بررسی‌ها اگر به این نتیجه رسیدید که پرداخت تسهیلات به پروژه‌ای خلاف مصالح کشور و بانک است و فشاری وارد می‌شد، موضوع را به ما منتقل کنید تا از شما حمایت کنیم. به هیچ وجه نباید اجازه داد کسی مصالح و منافع کشور را زیر پا بگذارد. [n] انتقاد از بنگاه‌داری بانک‌ها حجت‌الاسلام والمسلمین درویشیان با انتقاد از بنگاه‌داری بانک‌ها و با بیان اینکه ادعا می‌شود بانک‌ها اراده‌ای برای واگذاری بنگاه‌های خود ندارند، تصریح کرد: یکی از اشکالاتی که درباره بنگاه‌داری بانک‌ها مطرح می‌شود، این است که بانک‌ها تسهیلات ارزان قیمت را به بنگاه‌های خود اختصاص می‌دهند. با توجه به اتمام مهلت قانونی سه ساله واگذاری بنگاه‌های بانک‌ها هرچه زودتر این بنگاه‌ها را واگذار کرده و بر مسئولیت اصلی خود تمرکز کنید. [n] رئیس سازمان بازرسی کل کشور درخصوص واحدهای تولیدی تملک شده از سوی بانک‌ها نیز گفت: آقای رئیسی درخصوص بررسی این موضوع به ما ماموریت داده است و بنده نیز از همکاران خواسته‌ام آمار و اطلاعات همه واحدهای تملک شده در کل کشور را بگیرند. گفته می‌شود برخی واحدهای تولیدی بعد از واگذاری و تملک بانک تعطیل شده‌اند و اگر در اختیار مالک قبلی بود و یا اگر بانک مدیریت مجموعه را به مدیر قبلی می‌سپرد، این واحد تولیدی تعطیل نمی‌شد و این ذهنیت برای جامعه ایجاد شده که مشکل در بانک‌هاست. شما نیز کمک کنید تا گزارش جامع و کاملی تهیه شود تا اگر این اتهام متوجه بانک‌ها نیست، رفع شود. [n] وی با اشاره دریافت تسهیلات ارزان قیمت از سوی برخی افراد صاحب نفوذ که آن را نیز پس نمی‌دهند، اظهار داشت: لیست این افراد را به سازمان ارائه کنید و از شما رسما می‌خواهیم با قاطعیت این قبیل موارد را پیگیری کرده و نتیجه را هم به ما اعلام کنید. [n] حجت‌الاسلام والمسلمین درویشیان درخصوص رای وحدت رویه دیوانعالی کشور درخصوص قابل مطالبه نبودن سودهای مازاد بر دستورالعمل بانک مرکزی و شورای پول و اعتبار گفت: این مسئله بیشتر در بانک‌های خصوصی مبتلابه است. بنده نیز ابلاغ کرده‌ام در استان‌ها نظارت کنند تا این رای وحدت رویه اجرا شود. برخی از بانک‌ها سود قانونی سپرده را در یک حساب می‌ریزند و سود غیر قانونی را در حساب دیگری واریز می‌کنند. [n] رئیس سازمان بازرسی کل کشور با بیان اینکه اگر قانون مبارزه با پولشویی و آیین‌نامه آن درست اجرا شود، جلوی بسیاری از تخلفات گرفته می‌شود، گفت: در بازرسی‌ها به مواردی برخوردیم که از حساب‌های راکد سوءاستفاده می‌شود. حساب‌های بلا استفاده نباید راکد شود، بلکه به طور کل نباید دیگر قابل استفاده باشد. [n] در این دیدار محمدرضا حسین‌زاده رئیس شورای هماهنگی و مدیرعامل بانک ملی ایران، حجت‌الله صیدی مدیرعامل بانک صادرات، مصطفی پرتوافکنان عضو هیات مدیره بانک سپه، حسین مهری مدیرعامل بانک صنعت و معدن، روح‌الله خدارحمی مدیرعامل بانک کشاورزی، محمد بیگدلی مدیرعامل بانک ملت، بهزاد شیری مدیرعامل پست بانک ایران، محمود شایان مدیرعامل بانک مسکن، رضا دولت‌آبادی مدیرعامل بانک تجارت، علی صالح‌آبادی مدیرعامل بانک توسعه صادرات، اصغر نورالله‌زاده مدیرعامل صندوق کارآفرین امید و علیرضا قیطاسی دبیر شورای هماهنگی بانک‌ها حضور داشتند و دغدغه‌های خود را مطرح کردند.",

    "input": "به گزارش خبرنگار اقتصادی ایرنا، تازه‌ترین گزارش کمیسیون صنایع و معادن مجلس شورای اسلامی هم گویای آن است که بخش عمده صادرات محصولات فولادی در سال ۱۳۹۸ به صادرات شمش با سهمی ۶۱ درصدی اختصاص یافته که در مقایسه با محصولات نهایی از ارزش افزوده پایینی برخوردار است. [n] براساس آمار انجمن تولید کنندگان فولاد ایران در پنج ماهه نخست امسال از مجموع صادرات شمش و تولیدات فولادی که رقم دو میلیون و ۹۵۷ هزار تن ثبت شد، سهم شمش فولادی با رقم دو میلیون و ۲۱۳ هزار تن، سهم ۷۴٫۸ درصد را به خود اختصاص داد و تولیدات فولادی به میزان ۷۴۴ هزار تن سهم ۲۵٫۱ درصدی را دارد. [n] سال گذشته در دوره پنج ماهه چهار میلیون و ۱۵۷ هزار تن شمش و تولیدات فولادی صادر شد که شمش با رقم دو میلیون و ۶۸۹ هزار تن سهم ۶۴٫۶ درصدی و تولیدات فولادی با رقم یک میلیون و ۴۶۸ هزار تن سهم ۳۵٫۳ درصدی را ثبت کرد. [n] صادرات ۱۰٫۳ میلیون تنی فولاد [n] این انجمن در دورهک ساله ۹۸ آمار داد که مجموع صادرات شمش و تولیدات فولادی رقم ۱۰ میلیون و ۳۶۳ هزار تن بود و از این رقم ۶ میلیون و ۹۰۸ هزار تن سهم شمش با سهم ۶۶٫۶ درصدی و تولیدات با رقم سه میلیون و ۴۵۵ هزار تن سهم ۳۳٫۳ درصد را نشان می‌دهد. [n] آمارهای مورد بررسی گویای آن است که در سال‌های فعالیت دولت‌های یازدهم و دوازدهم (تاپنج ماهه امسال) بطور متوسط ۴۰ تا ۴۵ درصد ارزش صادرات بخش معدن و صنایع معدنی مربوط به صدور فولاد است. [n] ضرورت سیاستگذاری برای کل زنجیره [n] کمیسیون صنایع و معادن مجلس در گزارش خود تاکید کرد: هرگونه سیاستگذاری و تصمیم گیری در خصوص فولاد باید شامل کل زنجیره باشد تا از اتخاذ سیاست‌های متناقض در کل زنجیره اجتناب شود. [n] ضمن اینکهکی از معضلات زنجیره فولاد در سال‌های گذشته این بوده که به دلیل اخذ تصمیم‌های مقطعی، ارزش افزوده موجود در زنجیره به بخشی از زنجیره (مثلا فولاد سازی) سرازیر شده و باعث شده که شرکت‌های فعال در بخش معدن و کنسانتره و گندله از سرمایه گذاری در این بخش به سمت سرمایه گذاری در بخش فولادسازی هدایت شوند و این امر باعث ایجاد کمبود در بخشهایی از زنجیره فولاد شده است که تعادل زنجیره را برهم زده است. [n] ارزیابی مصرف داخلی فولاد [n] گزارش کمیسیون مزبور تصریح دارد: مصرف داخلی فولاد بسیار کمتر از تولید کشور بوده و در مقاطع طویل فولادی (میلگرد و تیرآهن) حدود ۷۶ درصد تولید و در مقاطع تخت فولادی (انواع ورقه‌های فولادی) حدود۸۰ درصد تولید در داخل مصرف شده و بقیه به خارج از کشور صادر شده است. [n] برپایه این بررسی در مجموع ۱۷ درصد کل تولیدات فولادی و ۲۵درصد شمش (بلوم و بیلت و اسلب) به خارج از کشور صادر شده است، بنظر می‌رسد که گزارش کمیسیون در ارتباط با این آمار مربوط به سال ۹۸ است. [n] همچنین کمیسیون در ارتباط با چهار ماهه ابتدای سال ۱۳۹۹ نیز آورده است، صادارت انواع مقاطع فولادی کاهش قابل ملاحظه‌ای داشته؛ بطوری‌که مقاطع طویل فولادی ۴۰ درصد، مقاطع تخت فولادی ۷۴ درصد، اما شمش دو درصد کاهش داشته و با توجه به اینکه شمش در طول زنجیره در مرحله قبل از محصولات مقاطع فولادی است؛ به منزله خام فروشی انجام شده است. [n] بورس کالا مرجع کشف قیمت [n] واقعیت اینکه از زمان راه اندازی بورس کالای ایران، مقرر شده کشف قیمت عادلانه محصولات فولادی در بورس کالا انجام شود و در گزارش کمیسیون آمده است، به همین دلیل مراجع تصمیم گیر درمقاطع مختلف بوسیله وزارت صنایع (سابق)، ستاد تنظیم بازار و غیره تلاش کرده‌اند که محصولات فولادی در بورس کالا عرضه شده و خریداران بتوانند با قیمت‌های منصفانه نسبت به خرید محصولات مورد نیاز خود اقدام نمایند. [n] آنچه که اکنون اتفاق افتاده، اینکه برخی از شرکت‌های تولید کننده بخشی از محصول خود را در بورس کالا عرضه می‌کنند و بقیه محصول را در بازار خارج از بورس و بدون هیچگونه شفافیتی به فروش می‌رسانند. [n] کمیسیون صنایع و معادن در گزارش خود تصریح دارد: بسیاری موارد این گمان وجود دارد که با عرضه حداقلی محصولات و استفاده از روشهای خاصی، برای یک محصول قیمت بالایی در بورس کشف می‌شود و بقیه محصول در خارج از بورس به همان قیمت بورس به فروش می‌رسد، در حالی‌که چنانچه کل محصول در بورس عرضه می‌شد، کل خریداران می‌توانستند با قیمت‌های پایین‌تری کالای مورد نیاز خود را خریداری کنند. [n] بطوری‌ که میزان عرضه در سال ۹۸ و چهار ماهه سال ۱۳۹۹ انواع ورق فولادی ۳۶ درصد و انواع میلگرد و تیرآهن ۲۵ درصد و شمش ۲۳ درصد در بورس عرضه شده است. [n] به گزارش ایرنا، سال ۱۳۹۷ نیز مجموع صادرات شمش و تولیدات فولادی به رقم هشت میلیون و ۴۸۰ هزار تن رسید که از این رقم پنج میلیون و ۴۹۳ هزار تن شمش فولادی با سهم ۶۴٫۷ درصد و دو میلیون و ۹۸۷ هزار تن تولیدات فولادی با سهم ۳۵٫۲ درصدی به خود اختصاص دادند.",

    "input": "Hamdali newspaper on August Azar published a note written by journalist Mazaher Guderzi and wrote: Last week when Zanandeh Gol passed away by the hand of God, everyone addressed this incident on his personal page in the virtual space, along with the official media. Most of the reactions were sad and full of emotions for losing Diego. There was no intellectual, political line and social and economic status to express regret for his death, but was only football the cause of Maradona's global popularity? [n] The fact that his football was a struggle is enough reason to express interest in him and there is no doubt about it, this Argentinian phenomenon on the green rectangle made amazing moves, according to the football players, he dribbled everyone in one place and it was a spectacular show. was throwing But it seems that this amount of popularity must have other reasons, which the writer tries to mention only two of them. As much as Maradona played brilliant football, he had a personal life full of fringes. [n] Addiction to alcohol and drugs had caused him to go to rehab camps many times, but he was still the same Maradona for all people, lovable and dear, he did not have an ironed life, he rarely appeared in public with a suit and tie, with He was far from the usual stylish football events, sometimes he made strange and unconventional comments in circles, and in short, he was not like many people, but he was very much like society. Just like people, he had a life full of mistakes and missed opportunities. Sometimes it even made irreversible mistakes. It was not at all like the unattainable and heavenly myths, it was not behind the showcase, it lived right here on earth. [n] People had seen him fall down and dance many times, people saw and heard the same jokes they had in private circles from Maradona on TV and in the media... d. Pay attention to this part of contemporary philosopher Slavi Žižek's words in the book The Impossible Desire: People do not want a perfect leader, but a leader who has weaknesses like themselves. Perhaps, in Žižek's interpretation, the era of politicians who want to show that they are omniscient and aware of all matters has passed, and society is looking for people like Maradona who are like them. But this was not enough for people to approach Maradona. People all over the world felt that Diego has something in him that they don't have, and he became desirable in this sense. Maradona was the same in public as he was in private. It was wrong, but not retouched or censored. He did not hide his thoughts, even if they were wrong according to many interpretations, so he was not disappointed, but happy. Something that many people do not have, and they are constantly caught in the entanglement of organizational policies and the most severe personal censorship. Organizations, what Weber referred to as bureaucratic iron cages, have turned people into something they are not, and Maradona did not give in to these organizational rules. Although he was far from some principles in his private life, he was the same in the public arena. What political philosophers call the right of integrity; That people have the right to be who they are. Maradona even made a will not to make any statue of him after his death; Because the statues have no resemblance to real people. He made big mistakes in life, but he didn't surprise anyone except on the football field. Because everyone knew that Diego was like himself.",
    "output": "Tehran IRNA newspaper Hamdali reported in an article: One of the reasons why Maradona was so popular was that everyone could get close to him for a reason. The most wrong people in the society, those who were affected by some social harms such as addiction, saw themselves close to him."
